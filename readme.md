# TMDB Movie Dataset Analysis
This project aims to analyze the TMDB movie dataset to provide insights to the movie industry on how to earn more profits. The dataset contains information on about 10,000 movies, including their budget, revenue, runtime, genres, production companies, and release dates.

# Tools Used
To perform the analysis, we used the following tools:

NumPy
pandas
matplotlib
# Files
The project consists of the following files:

tmdb-movies.csv: The dataset we used for our analysis
movie_analysis.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook containing the analysis code
README.md: This file
# Analysis
The analysis includes the following:

Data Cleaning: We cleaned the dataset by dropping duplicate values and null values.
Data Exploration: We explored the dataset by answering questions such as:
Which genres are most popular from year to year?
What are the most profitable movies?
Which production companies produce the most profitable movies?
What is the relationship between budget and revenue?
What is the average runtime of movies over time?
Data Visualization: We used various visualization techniques to better understand the dataset, including:
Line charts to show trends over time
Bar charts to compare different categories
Scatter plots to show the relationship between two variables

# Conclusion
Through our analysis, we found several insights that can help the movie industry increase their profits. For example, we found that Adventure, Action, and Science Fiction movies are the most profitable genres, and that movies produced by Universal Pictures and Warner Bros. are the most profitable. We also found that there is a positive correlation between budget and revenue, but it is not always the case.
